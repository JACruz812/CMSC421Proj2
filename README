Linux kernel Project 2, Tony Cruz, CMSC421
============
This project is to create a new kernel data structure called mailboxes, implementing linked lists

10-3-20 update:
Today i worked on the user-space prototype for the mailboxes DS.
I made the create, write, delete, and add functions and they run successfully
Only issue atm is that the write function is leaking

Future steps includes implementing other funcs and eliminating mem leaks.


10-11-20 update:
This weekend i worked on moving the mailbox DS to kernel space as well as creating tests for the separate space implementations.
I was able to create a truncate function as well that ensures the user passes in a name that is less than 64 chars or truncates it if it's longer
So far all of the functions work in user space but there are still issues with the list fucntion in kernel space.


10-16-20 Final Update:
This week i finished up the implementations on the mailbox IPC datastructure. I was able to get all the functions working without any memory leaks and created an test directory. This directory holds the drivers that I tested my system calls with. The tests consisted of mostly edge cases given that basic functionality was obvious. I'm definitly glad i took my time on this one
