This is a readme for Tony Cruz's CMSC421 Project 2 Test Drivers

The concept of my testing was to approach each parameter and their possible edge cases for each system call. Given that most vars were unsigned i didn't have to test for negative values although i did test for invalid pointers, names, sizes, and PID/UID in case of faulty error input.
Given basic functionality is required to perform tests they're less focused on

quick rundown of tests:
Create: invalid name, duplicate name, overflow size
Resize: invalid name
Delete: incorrect PID/UID, Invalid name
Write: Invalid pointer, oversized offset/size, invalid name
Read: Invalid pointer, oversized offset/size, invalid name
Size: empty/full Mailbox, invalid mailbox
List: over/undersized max_entries, invalid list
Count:Empty mailbox list, full list
 




The make file works as so....

1. run [ make ] to build initial test batch
2. run [ ./big ] for initial tests
3. [ cd last_test ] and run [ make ] to build last test
2. run [ ./last ] to test delete from separate process
3. run [ sudo ./last ] to test delete from root privileges 



Thank you for grading my project, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
